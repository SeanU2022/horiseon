# Code Refactor Opportunity

## How the mock Horiseon Website was made more accessible. 

The Horiseon Landing Page presented had a number of technical issues that needed to be addressed to allow for Search Engine Optimisation and to allow for an increase in accessibility.

### The Challenge


* **Clean up the code** Refactor existing code so that Horiseons' website was more accessible.  As an online marketing agency this accessibility is a critical success factor before they are willing take the next step with search engine market leaders such as Google and Bing.

* **Improve the codebase for long-term sustainability** Ensure all links function correctly, CSS selectors and properties get consolidated, organise HTML elements to follow a logical semantic structure, and comment appropriately.

* **More accessibility** Increase web accessibility, with minimal impact on the source code, so that people with disabilities can access this website using assistive technologies (for that: video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards).

* **Limited Budget** This task had to be completed quickly because Horiseon had a deadline to avoid litigation; which might arise if people with disabilities continue to be unable to access websites.

### The Outcome

With the technical skills gained I was able to meet the criteria for the challenge.  As you will see n the codebase: all links are working, sematic elements have been applied with a sructure to maximise SEO, CSS has been reduced by 30%, and for longevity commentary has been added to make future updates not only possilble but easy to implement.  This was completed under budget (ie early).

* **Acceptance Criteria**: These are the requirements that you must meet to satisfy the scope of work. They are not exhaustive, but they do entail the minimum aspects of a working solution. Consider this a checklist of baseline requirements. Acceptance criteria can be presented in various ways. In this case, we'll use a common format called **scenario-oriented criteria** . 


* **Mock-up**: This is an image or animation that demonstrates the design and functionality of the web application that you'll build for the Challenge.

* **Submission**: You'll submit your completed Challenge for review. In the real world, when a developer finishes working on a project, another developer reviews the code, providing feedback on errors and making sure that all of the acceptance crite.

## Your Task

This week is an odd-numbered week, so your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket&mdash;meaning that you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. 

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

> **Important**: When working with someone else's code, you should adhere to the **Scout Rule**&mdash;always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

Accessibility can include complex requirements, but your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

To impress clients, you should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready to begin? Here are this week's Challenge requirements.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
